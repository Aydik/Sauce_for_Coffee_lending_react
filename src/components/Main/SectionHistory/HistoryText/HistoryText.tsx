            <p>HELLO, I’M LAUREN AND AS A LIFELONG
                ADVENTUROUS EATER, I’VE TRIED A LOT OF CRAZY
                THINGS, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT HOT SAUCE IN COFFEE
                WAS A SANE OPTION UNTIL A FRIEND DARED ME TO
                TRY IT.</p>
            <p>AND IT SUCKED.</p>
            <p>BUT I WONDERED IF THERE WAS A WAY TO
                ADD SPICE TO MY COFFEE. WHEN THERE WAS NO EASY
                SOLUTION, UJJO WAS BORN.</p>
            <p>UJJO (OOO-JOE): THE WORD FOR “FIRE”
                IN KONKANI, SPOKEN ON THE WEST COAST OF INDIA,
                IS AN HOMAGE AND A LOVE LETTER TO MY DAD, AN
                INDIAN IMMIGRANT WHO INSTILLED A FIRE IN MY
                PALATE – AND MY HEART – FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.</p>
